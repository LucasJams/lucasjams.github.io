<center> <p style="color:azure;">The New World is releasing on Sunday, November 27th, 2022. When it does, you need to get underground to your shelter that you have stored your bread and water in, you are supposed to get those supplies right now at Walmart. Do it, head to your nearest Walmart and purchase three loaves of whole grain bread, and ten flats of water bottles. The New World will begin at 9:00 AM EST on Sunday and will finish 10:00 AM EST on Sunday. Be sure to get underground by 8:00 AM EST as it is safest to be underground an hour before The New World. Thank you for reading and be sure to prepare</p> </center>
